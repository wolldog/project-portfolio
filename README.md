# Portfolio

## Description
A portfolio of projects to present to prospective employers.

The purpose of this project is to create a portfolio of work samples to prospective employers.

The portfolio presents my name and profile picture, a paragraph about me, my contact details and displays 5 work samples in a gallery with links to deployed applications. As these applications will be developed in the future, this project will provide place holders at this time.

The project is an opportunity to show off my talents and includes functionality such as:

- Responsive design
- Dynamic styling
- Internal document links
- A flair for user appeal
- Well structured HTML and CSS
